This is designed to realize the classification on specific pre-trained model, the Inception V3 for instance. Temporally, the classification_new.cpp is intended to do the pressure test, which wanted to test the maximum prediction ability of caffe.
<1> Model: Ported Inception V3 from TensorFlow
<2> Batch_size: Supported.
<3> GPU: Supported
<4> Multi-thread CPU: Supported. (OpenBLAS?)
